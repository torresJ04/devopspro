# GIT IGNORE  

`git ignore` is the file where you specify folders and files in which the git repository won't detect them when you perform `git add .` and commits.

Into the .gitignore file, you can mention file extensions to ignore.

When performing `git status`
*.log -> would make ignore all .log files.
bin/ -> would make ignore bin/.
